#### About Me

I am a recent graduate of BYU-Idaho with a major in data science and minor in finance. I enjoy how the right data in the right light can open up new possibilities for growth and innovation. I love learning new things! I started out my data science journey. I descided that business management was not the path I wanted to pursue. Somehow got into a advanced math class about data manipuation and visualization that was taught in R. I work hard and have loved programming ever since. 

My top skills are now in python. I have done many things from machine learing to web developement. Over the course of my learing I have picked up the basics of SQL, javascript and html, python, R, VBA, and DAX. I enjoy taking complex processes and automating them.
